PYTHON PRACTICE EXCERCISE
1.Character Input
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

2.Odd Or Even
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

3.List Less Than Ten
Take a list a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
#a	Instead of printing the elements one by one,
	make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
#b	Write this in one line of Python.
#c	Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a 
	that are smaller than that number given by the user.

4.Divisors
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

5.List Overlap
Take two lists, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
And write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

#a	Randomly generate two lists to test this
#b	Write this in one line of Python 

6.String Lists
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
